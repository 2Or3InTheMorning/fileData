King Arthur  who held sway in Camelot with his Knights of the Round Table  was supposedly a king of Britain hundreds of years ago  Most of the stories about him are probably not historically true  but there was perhaps a real king named Arthur  or with a name very much like Arthur  who ruled somewhere in the island of Britain about the sixth century 
Among the romantic spires and towers of Camelot  King Arthur held court with his queen  Guinevere  According to tradition  he received mortal wounds in battling with the invading Saxons  and was carried magically to fairyland to be brought back to health and life  Excalibur was the name of King Arthur's sword  in fact  it was the name of two of his swords  One of these tremendous weapons Arthur pulled from the stone in which it was imbedded  after all other knights had failed  This showed that Arthur was the proper king  The other Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake  she reached her hand above the water  as told in the story  and gave the sword to the king  When Arthur was dying  he sent one of his Knights of the Round Table  Sir Bedivere  to throw the sword back into the lake from which he had received it
The Knights of the Round Table were so called because they customarily sat about a huge marble table  circular in shape  Some say that thirteen knights could sit around that table  others say that as many as a hundred and fifty could find places there  There sat Sir Galahad  who would one day see the Holy Grail  Sir Gawain was there  nephew of King Arthur  Sir Percivale  too  was to see the Holy Grail  Sir Lancelot  Lancelot of the Lake  who was raised by that same Lady of the Lake who gave Arthur his sword  was the most famous of the Knights of the Round Table  He loved Queen Guinevere 
All the knights were sworn to uphold the laws of chivalry  to go to the aid of anyone in distress  to protect women and children  to fight honorably  to be pious and loyal to their king
